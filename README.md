# 4thSlot

A proof of concept for a new mouse navigation mode for [Scoot](https://github.com/mjrusso/scoot). Idea is to divide the screen to a 2x2 grid each selectable with a dedicated key. Selecting a cell will create a new 2x2 grid inside that cell. Process continues until the center of the grid is on the desired target. Center of the grid determines to mouse pointer location.
